## Other projects (partially or fully) in the same vein
- _Motion_  
  The excellent project that made me start this project. Primarily motion detection, less focus on streaming.
  https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion
- _Motion (MMAL)_  
  http://wiki.raspberrytorte.com/index.php?title=Motion_MMAL  
- _Motioneye_  
  This is what I _wish_ did what I wanted (depends on Motion)
- _UV4L_  
  Streaming only, I believe. Ran into it many years ago for another project, ran into bugs, closed source so could not debug.  
- _Rpisurv_  
  Require multiple devices (it's essentially a camera server)  
  https://github.com/esiexata/rpisurv
- _iSpy_  
  Streaming only.  
  https://github.com/esiexata/iSpy
- _Telepi_  
  Streaming only (and not to web clients)  
  https://github.com/esiexata/telepi
- _Kerberos_  
  Streaming and motion detection. Looks great. I am however unable to get real low-latency stream going.

- _A number of video streaming implementations depending on Broadway.js_  
	https://github.com/131/h264-live-player  
	https://github.com/pimterry/raspivid-stream  
	https://github.com/pimterry/pi-cam  
	https://github.com/matijagaspar/ws-avc-player  
	https://github.com/TeaFlex/PiStreamer  
- _Shinobi_
	Looks great. Seem to promise it all and more. Performance is however lacking on these devices. I.e. streaming
	in combination with timelapse, and then of course similarly with motion detection.
